# Lab-4.3

Using the updated BST.cpp that we wrote as a class, create a method called optimize that alters the BST so it has the smallest total retrieval time given that the probability that each node will be searched for is equal. Remember that the BST we created holds ints. 

Below is the equation given by the text slightly altered for this scenario. Note that n is the number of nodes in the tree. Thus, the probability for any given node is 1/n.
